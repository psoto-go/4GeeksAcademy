## ‚û°Ô∏è Incremental & ‚úîÔ∏è Autograded

- I've built the exercises incrementally, you should feel the progress little by little, and hopefully, the difficulty raising between exercises will never be too big to get you frustrated.
- All exercises have been automatically graded thanks to [@username](https://github.com/haydavid23)
