# `06` Fieldsets, labels and styles

Styling a form is boring and tedious, but if you use certain tags you life can become more easy. 

`<label>`  
One of the tipical things you need to do is add a "label" to your input, label's tell the end-user what the input stands for.

`<fieldset>`  

Are ideal to add several inputs into the same logical group (for example grouping to radios -male and female- into a gender fieldset).

`<legend>`  

Is the name of the fieldset group that is going to be shown to the end-user.

## üìù Instructions

1. Make the font beautiful by applying this font to the body:

```css
font-family: "Lato", sans-serif;
```

2. Remove borders and margins from all the fieldsets. Apply a padding of 10px to the top and bottom and a padding of 0px to the left and right. Apply a font weight of 800.

3. Decrease the font-weight off all the lable's to 400

4. Apply these rules to all the text inputs

```css
input[type=text] {
	border: none;
	border-bottom: 1px solid black;
	font-size: 16px;
}
```

5. Apply this style to the submit button

```css
input[type=submit] {
  cursor: pointer;
  border: none;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #f65252;
  color: white;
  width: 100%;
}
```

The result should look like this:
